> **Argo CD on easy mode**

The apps repo architecture is an emerging standard for formatting and storing

* Templates for ApplicationSets
* Patterns that for facilitate self-service for developers and multi-cluster managment
* Built-in security and autonomy for development teams

you why this is just so cool.

## Show me an example!

Of course! Have a look at:
